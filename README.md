# GANsTraining

gen_images and all_logs contain Images and graphs of saved model. Number in file name corresponds to a trained model:
*results0: model trained on 4815 images 500k steps

*results1: model trained on 16500 images 500k steps
*results2: previous model trained until 1340k steps
*results3: previous model trained until 1735k steps
*results4: previous model trained until 1950k steps, with changed lambda to try reducing weird artifacts

*results5: model trained on 1680 images 600k steps lambda=100
*results6: previous model trained until 1100k steps lambda=200
*results7: previous model trained until 1600k steps lambda=200
