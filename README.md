# GANsTraining

## gen_images and all_logs contain Images and graphs of saved model

Number in file name corresponds to a trained model:

* results0: model trained on 4815 images 500k steps

* results1: model trained on 16500 images 500k steps
* results2: previous model trained until 1340k steps
* results3: previous model trained until 1735k steps
* results4: previous model trained until 1950k steps, with changed lambda to try reducing weird artifacts

* results5: model trained on 1680 images 600k steps lambda=100
* results6: previous model trained until 1100k steps lambda=150
* results7: previous model trained until 1600k steps lambda=150

# Code and datasets are available in corresponding folders, also can use it all on kaggle:

* code – https://www.kaggle.com/code/kalviskalnins/gans-training
* saved checkpoints and logs – https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kalviskalnins/results
* dataset – https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kalviskalnins/dataset

# There are also scripts used in dataset creation

The code should not be used, since it is simple, but bad and ugly.
The scripts did their job and I'm saving them just in case.
